# Python reading
I ended up just taking a bunch of notes because I did't really know any of this and thought this would be a good place to store new information :)
- **Chapter 1:** Do I write "<<<<" or does Python respond to my code with "<<<<" Confused.
- () is a function.
- Use "" to program begining and ending of text.
- ** raises a number to a power.
- Tokens are legal characters in a language.
- I already knew about a number as an integer, a decimal as a floating point, and a word as a string.
- **Chapter 3:** Kind of Confused with dot notation.It basically just gives the function more information?
- Left side of argument has to be a variable name.
- Make your own functions using "def" for function definition.
- Straight vs. curly quotes?
- Once you have defined a function you can use it inside another function.
- I think I understand local parameters, but I can see where they might trip me up.
- Traceback can help find function error.
"Fruitful Functions" return a result while "Void Functions" perform a task but to not return a result.
-  I knew that statements were run one at a time from top to bottom.
- **Chapter 5:** "//" divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer.
- "%" divides two numbers and returns the remainder.
- The Boolean expression after "if" is considered a condition.
- branches are alternatives when conditions are given two possible outcomes.
- Recursive funtions call themselves.
- A bit confused with infinite recursion; is this something to worry about?
- I knew about Boolean expressions from class. They are true or false expressions.  
**Chapter 10:** Create a list with brackets.
- Range, len, and i? What does this all mean?
- "*" Repeats lists in parenthesis (multiplication).
- Lists split using ":" based on whether numbers come before or after the colon.
- Sort arranges things from low to high.
- total += x == total=total+x
- "Sum" adds numbers.
- How to use reduce command?
- Can use "pop" and "del" to remove elements from lists.
- Can use "list" "Split" and "delimiter" to break up strings into lists.
- Two different objects with the same values vs. two of the same objects. Identical vs. Equivilent.
"delete_head" removes first element from list. 
- I didn't REALLY know this- but aliasing is not good in audio engineering, so it made sense to me that it is error prone in coding too.
