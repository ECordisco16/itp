**FizzBuzz**
- First I wrote out a range of numbers using index (1,101)and ran that to make sure I got a full list of numbers.
Next I wrote out the division code which was if the index was divisible by 3 or 5 then print "Fizzbuzz". I used "% 3 == 0" for divisibility.
Used if and elif.
Ran the code and was surprised to see only fizz buzz and no numbers. Took me a while to think about how to add the rest of the numbers back in.
Used "else" command to put the rest of the numbers back in if they arent divisible by 3 or 5.
