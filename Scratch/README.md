# Scratch
Started with creating character Jellyfish.
Created my second character, Shark.
Told Jellyfish to glide in the direction of Shark with the intention of them overlapping.
First, tried command: "If touching Jellyfish say CHOMP". However the Shark did not seem to register when the Jellyfish touched it.
Instead, changed command to "Wait 2 seonds and say CHOMP". This worked.
Took a step back and created starting positions for both characters so that they would interact the same way every time.
Told the Jellyfish to wait 3 seconds and then say "OUCH!" As if the shark had bit it.
Told the Jellyfish to change to costumes b, c, and d.
Realized that when I started the loop over, the Jellyfish stayed in costume D, so added a command to start in costume A.
Insterted Ocean sound at begining of sequence.
Tried to use "repeat once" on "Chomp" command for Shark but did not work.
Changed command to "Say CHOMP for 2 seconds"
Trying to figure out how to get Shark to leave the screen.
Noticed the ocean sound is only playing once.
Put command "Hide" at the end of Shark's sequence.
This made is so I had to start its sequence with "show".
Added a repeat/ loop to the Jellyyfish costume changes.
Still trying to figure out how to continue ocean sound.
Added new "When green flag clicked" command and put the ocean sound within a forever module.
For the storyline purpose going to add a mermaid to save the jellyfish.
Created a sequence for mermaid that included hide in begining, wait 8 seconds (for the begining of the storyline to unfold),show at a starting point, and glide to the Jellyfish.
Created a conversation between Jellyfish and Mermaid.
Still need to add variable. Don't exactly understand what variable means.
Watched this Youtube video : https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+variable+in+scract&oq=what+is+a+variable+in+scract&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQABgNGIAEMgkIAhAAGA0YgAQyCQgDEAAYDRiABDIICAQQABgWGB4yCAgFEAAYFhgeMggIBhAAGBYYHjINCAcQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAgQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAkQABiGAxiABBiKBdIBCDM2MjNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:beb95c15,vid:5vK9IL4tCbk,st:0 to understand variables.
I used a similar variable to the youtube video where I used it to change the size of my character. Storyline wise I don't know how well it works, but I figured out the variables.
Finsihed project after adding variable.
