**MICE**
- First I used the code that you gave us: "print("col1\tcol2\tcol3\ncol1\tcol2\tcol3\ncol1\tcol2\tcol3")"
- Then I created some variables such as "a = 1+2", b = blind, c = mice.
I made a "print" command and tried to plug the variables into the original line of code.
- A red line of code appeared starting after "blind" in "print(f"a\t\t\n\tf"Blind\t\n\t\tf"c)""
Upon talking to Rachel I learned I was performing many syntax errors. I don't need a "f"" everytime I want to use a variable- instead I use {} once I have defined my variable. I also need to remember to use "" when defining string variables.
Code ended up being print(f"{a}\t\t\n\t{b}\t\n\t\t{c}")
Makes sense.
