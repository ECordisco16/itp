**Band Project**
- We collaborated as a group to decide on the theme of our band, music, and aesthetic. We had a lot of fun and took the Toyota theme pretty far (for what reason I don't know).
- We each spent time writing our own bios and finding some images and music that we could add to our website.
- Mathis was in charge of actually adding the code to the website as Bri and I sent him content to add.
- Bri and I also researched some examples of code to show Mathis so that we could implement it into our own website.
- I found the specific numbers and names of the colors that we would use and Mathis added it to the code of our site.
- We didn't really run into many "problems", but a couple things took extra time to add to our website such as the photo and gif. Mathis had to reogranize which folder the images were in so that the code could call to the right place on his computer that was connected to the index file.
- I think we all worked well together and took on a good amount of work. Although Mathis was actually adding the code, Bri and I added examples into the Google Doc that we all shared so he could basically replicate those.
